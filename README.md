# 4-bit_Processor
This is a project to build a fully working 4-bit processor made with discrete logic gates.
The processor is programmed with an Arduino MEGA and can be programmed in the assembly language based off of my architecture.

This is a project that is still being worked on. The schematics can currently be found in the Schematics branch. The file type of the schematics is for KiCAD.
