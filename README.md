# 4-bit_Processor
This is a project to build a fully working 4-bit processor made with discrete logic gates.
The processor is programmed with an Arduino MEGA and can be programmed in the assembly language based off of my architecture.

The schematics can currently be found in the Schematics branch. The file type of the schematics is for KiCAD.
The RAM and ROM have an associated PCB design.
